# Trees of New West

Data source: the City of New Westminster's tree inventory dataset:
- https://opendata.newwestcity.ca/datasets/newwestcity::tree-inventory/explore


Contains information licenced under the Open Government Licence - City of New Westminster:

**Update, February 2022:**  It looks like the city's data website has
been redesigned, and I can't find the dataset there anymore.  I've
emailed the city to see what's up, but in the meantime this repo has
the last JSON file I downloaded from May 2021.

**Update, March 2022:** It's back!  The dataset can be downloaded
here:

Thank you to the City of New Westminster for doing this.

Note: it looks like this dataset now covers the whole city, instead of
being split into east/west like it was before.  I have not yet tried
this new dataset in this repo.  As noted above, the repo still has the
last JSON file I downloaded in May 2021.
