# Init

From https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/postgres/:

> If you would like to do additional initialization in an image
> derived from this one, add one or more *.sql, *.sql.gz, or *.sh
> scripts under /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d (creating the directory if
> necessary). After the entrypoint calls initdb to create the default
> postgres user and database, it will run any *.sql files, run any
> executable *.sh scripts, and source any non-executable *.sh scripts
> found in that directory to do further initialization before starting
> the service.
